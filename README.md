# FinP2P Ethereum Reference Adapter

The FinP2P Ethereum adapter is a reference implementation of a FinP2P adapter to EVM compatiable ledgers. It allows to execute FinP2P instructions to trade tokenized assets on the Ethereum network.
The Adapter communicated with a FinP2P proxy contract on Ethereum network which is responsible to verify and execute the asset movements on chain.

## Documentation

- [Design choices](specs/design.md)
- [Contract details and scripts](./finp2p-contracts/README.md)

### Getting started


#### Install dependencies


`npm clean-install`

#### Compile contracts and generate typescript bindings

The contracts project is located in ./finp2p-contract folder and has its own dependencies to be installed. 

`cd finp2p-contracts && npm install && npm run compile`

#### Run contracts tests

`cd finp2p-contracts && npm run test`

#### Run adapter tests

By default, test environment starts Hardhat node within test-containers and adapter server and run tests against it.

`npm test`

#### External ethereum network

To run tests against external network, set `network.rpcUrl` parameter in `jest.config.js` to the desired network url.


To run tests against external adapter, set `adapter.url` parameter in `jest.config.js` to the desired adapter url.


#### Run migration scripts

After deploying new FinP2P contract the old data should be migrated to the new contract. The migration script could be run using npx command:

```
npx -p @owneraio/finp2p-ethereum-adapter migration \
    --operator_pk 0xa11db02ddd62302c8cb4e6f07f058726061e7fa42502cda442a65fb8aaf76ca1 \
    --rpc_url https://ethereum-sepolia-rpc.publicnode.com \
    --organization_id bank-us \
    --oss_url http://localhost:9000 \
    --finp2p_contract_address 0x8464135c8F25Da09e49BC8782676a84730C318bD

```
